📊 IT Control Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor and evaluate key indicators across IT Governance, IT Operations, and Change Management.
This repository provides the dataset and documentation needed to run and understand the dashboard.

🚀 Overview

The IT Control Dashboard helps organizations visualize and track critical IT processes, including:

1. Incident & Request Management
2. Change Management Process
3. Access & Identity Management
4. User Activity Monitoring
5. IT Risk & Compliance
6. Application Inventory & Ownership

The dashboard is built using Power BI and uses the dataset included in this repository.

📄 Dataset Description

The main dataset is stored in dataset/IT_Control_Dashboard_Dataset.xlsx and includes several sheets, such as:

User Logins	User login activity (UserID, Timestamp, Device, Status)
Incidents	IT incidents including priority, status, SLA, and assignee
Requests	Service requests submitted by users
Change Management	Change requests, risk levels, types, approvers
User Access	Mapping of users, and roles

This dataset is intended for demonstration and IT control analysis practice.

📊 Power BI Visuals Used

The dashboard uses a variety of Power BI visuals, including:

Bar & Column Charts – incidents, change type distribution, SLA performance

Pie / Donut Charts – status breakdown, category composition

Cards / KPI Indicators – total incidents, completed changes, active users

Matrix Table – detailed logs, user access list
